                <p class="bio">
                    Puzzles and problem-solving are major interests of mine, and
                    I love how well coding feeds those interests. Coming from an
                    engineering background, I've grown to deeply appreciate
                    coding's potential for rapid development cycles. <br />To
                    that end, I hope that I will be able to work with
                    other developers who share my passions so we can learn and
                    grow together.

                    In my downtime I enjoy winemaking, traveling the world, and

                            This app allows users to quickly generate randomized
                            maps with different terrains and tweak them to their
                            preferences. Users can save these maps for later use
                            if they create an account.

                            of creating maps to be distracting from my main goal
                            of telling a story.

                            by those responsible for planning routes and
                            allocating resources. Users first define components

                            where there are inefficiencies in their current

                            our systems. They seemed like they needed a place to
                            start, so I designed a diagnostic tool for the
                            general case.
